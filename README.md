Why did I choose these algorithms?

Random Forest is a strong choice for handling multicollinearity in health datasets due to its inherent feature selection mechanism. By randomly selecting a subset of features at each split, Random Forest minimizes the risk of overfitting to highly correlated variables. In a health dataset, where factors like patient demographics, symptoms, or lab results might be correlated, this randomization ensures that the model doesn't over-rely on any one predictor. Additionally, Random Forest averages the predictions from multiple decision trees, smoothing out the effect of any multicollinearity that might occur in individual trees, which can result in a more robust and generalized model for health outcomes.

XGBoost is another excellent algorithm for datasets with multicollinearity, largely due to its built-in regularization capabilities. In health datasets, where multiple predictors like lifestyle factors and medical history might be closely correlated, XGBoost's L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques penalize large coefficients, preventing the model from overfitting to redundant features. Furthermore, XGBoost’s gradient-boosting approach focuses on optimizing prediction error across iterations, reducing the influence of correlated features by adjusting weights in a way that emphasizes the most impactful predictors, even if they are correlated. This makes XGBoost a powerful and flexible tool for accurate prediction in health-related applications.

Neural Networks are particularly suitable for health datasets with multicollinearity due to their ability to model non-linear relationships and automatically learn from complex data patterns. Health data often contains interdependent features—such as lab results that are influenced by both biological factors and medical history—but neural networks can capture these interactions through hidden layers without being explicitly affected by correlations between input features. Regularization techniques like L2 and dropout further ensure that the model doesn’t overfit to any correlated variables, making neural networks highly effective in extracting meaningful insights from health data while mitigating the impact of multicollinearity.
